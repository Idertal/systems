# systems

This repository contains practical systems and tools used in real workflows.

Focus areas:
- automation pipelines
- AI-assisted tools
- internal utilities
- workflow optimization

## Philosophy

These systems are built to:
- reduce friction
- improve speed or quality
- support real production contexts

## Structure

Each system documents:
- the problem it addresses
- the context where it is used
- the solution and design decisions
- trade-offs and constraints

## Notes

- Code here prioritizes reliability over experimentation.
- Only tools with real use cases are included.
